A solid machine learning model requires accurate estimations\n        of the distribution of the data-generating process. Nonetheless, the\n        distribution of the data may be unpredictable for a variety of reasons:\n        insufficient observations in the stationary case, a time-varying law in\n        the non-stationary example, or a law sensitive to policy intervention\n        due to the treatment effect. In robust statistics, a solution to\n        distributional uncertainty in the data is to formulate a decision-making\n        problem as a DRO problem.\n      </TypographyBody>\n      {demoImage}\n\n      <TypographyTitle>\n        Unstructured Data: The main source of information\n      </TypographyTitle>\n      <TypographyBody>\n        Unlike structured data — which is organized in a searchable format, like\n        a database — unstructured data doesn’t adhere to conventional data\n        models. These forms of data are often more challenging to interpret, the\n        Deloitte report said, but can deliver a more comprehensive and holistic\n        understanding of the bigger picture. Because structured data is easier\n        to work with, companies have already been able to do a lot with it.\n        Unstructured data, by its definition, is data that doesn’t exist in a\n        pre-defined model. So, this could include video, audio or entire\n        documents or emails. Since files themselves contain dates, times, facts\n        and opinions they hold a wealth of information. Yet, because this isn’t\n        in a format that can be processed through traditional data analytics,\n        banks have struggled to analyse it.\n      </TypographyBody>\n      {demoImage}\n\n      <TypographyTitle>Feature Selection</TypographyTitle>\n      <TypographyBody>\n        Almost seldom, when developing a machine learning model in practice, are\n        all variables in the dataset usable for building the model. Adding\n        redundant variables affects the model's capacity to generalize and may\n        also reduce a classifier's overall accuracy. Adding ever more variables\n        to a model raises the model's overall complexity. According to Occam's\n        Razor's Law of Parsimony, the best explanation for a problem is the one\n        that makes the fewest assumptions. Consequently, feature selection\n        becomes an essential component of developing machine learning models.\n      </TypographyBody>\n      {demoImage}\n\n      <TypographyTitle>Financial Modeling</TypographyTitle>\n      <TypographyBody>\n        Utilization of machine learning in finance has developed significantly\n        during the past decade. Learning by machine is a novel methodological\n        development. Finance employs a variety of machine learning techniques\n        (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning, and others) to handle\n        problems that are fundamentally distinct from those addressed by\n        conventional economic approaches. The most valued application of machine\n        learning in finance is process automation. The technique of machine\n        learning can automate repetitive operations, substitute manual labor,\n        and boost production. Companies are able to minimize their costs,\n        improve consumer experiences, and scale up their services thanks to\n        machine learning.\n      </TypographyBody>\n      {demoImage}\n\n      <TypographyTitle>Backtest</TypographyTitle>\n      <TypographyBody>\n        Backtesting is the standard way for determining how a strategy or model\n        would have performed in the past. Backtesting evaluates a trading\n        strategy's viability by determining how it would have performed using\n        previous data. If backtesting is effective, traders and analysts may\n        have the confidence to use it in the future. A well-executed backtest\n        that delivers favorable results reassures traders that the strategy is\n        fundamentally sound and likely to generate profits when applied in the\n        real world. A well-executed backtest that provides unsatisfactory\n        results, on the other hand, will drive traders to modify or reject the\n        strategy.\n      </TypographyBody>\n      {demoImage}\n\n      <TypographyTitle>Trading Strategies</TypographyTitle>\n      <TypographyBody>\n        There are two possible methods for developing strategies: model-based\n        and data mining. These are fundamentally contradictory approaches. In\n        model-based strategy development, we begin with a model of a market\n        inefficiency, establish a mathematical representation of it, and assess\n        its long-term viability. Typically, this model is a simplification of\n        the actual complex model, and its long-term importance and stability\n        must be confirmed. This category includes prevalent trend-following,\n        mean-reversion, and arbitrage methods. In contrast, the data mining\n        approach begins by searching for pricing trends and then attempting to\n        fit an algorithm to them. It is irrelevant what generates these\n        patterns, simply that they will continue to repeat in the future. This\n        is a blind strategy, and we require rigorous checks to distinguish\n        between real and random patterns. This area includes trial-and-error TA,\n        candle patterns, and regression on a large number of features.\n      </TypographyBody>\n      {demoImage}\n\n      <TypographyTitle>Portfolio Optimization</TypographyTitle>\n      <TypographyBody>\n        Risk-based and heuristic portfolio construction methods have recently\n        received a great deal of attention from both academics and practitioners\n        because they do not rely on the estimation of expected returns and are\n        therefore believed to be more stable than Markowitz's conventional\n        mean-variance portfolio. In 2016, Lopez de Prado introduced Hierarchical\n        Risk Parity (HRP), a new technique to portfolio formation that blends\n        hierarchical clustering of assets with a heuristic risk-based allocation\n        strategy to improve out-of-sample performance and promote portfolio\n        stability. Lopez de Prado was able to show encouraging findings using\n        Monte Carlo simulations.\n      </TypographyBody>\n      {demoImage}\n\n      <TypographyTitle>Risk Management</TypographyTitle>\n      <TypographyBody>\n        Risk management is the process of identifying, analyzing, and accepting\n        or mitigating uncertainty in investment choices in the financial sector.\n        In essence, risk management happens when an investor or fund manager\n        examines and attempts to quantify the potential for losses in an\n        investment, such as moral hazard, and then takes the proper action or\n        inaction in light of the fund's investment objectives and risk\n        tolerance. Risk is inseparable from return. Every investment has some\n        degree of risk, which is near to zero for U.S. Treasury bills and quite\n        high for emerging-market shares and real estate in highly inflationary\n        environments. Risk can be measured in both absolute and relative levels.\n        A solid grasp of risk in its various manifestations can help investors\n        comprehend the opportunities, trade-offs, and costs associated with\n        various investing strategies.\n      </TypographyBody>\n      {demoImage}\n\n      <TypographyTitle>Climate Risk</TypographyTitle>\n      <TypographyBody>\n        Climatic change is the long-term evolution of global climate patterns.\n        These alterations are typically attributable to human activity, such as\n        the consumption of nonrenewable resources such as fossil fuels. These\n        energy sources contribute to global warming by releasing greenhouse\n        gases into the atmosphere when they are burned. Climate money is a means\n        by which individuals and nations may combat climate change. Climate\n        financing has both broad and specific applications. In its broadest\n        definition, it refers to a business that employs financial institutions\n        or technologies to promote environmental sustainability, such as by\n        creating or deploying additional solar panels or other renewable energy\n        sources. Climate financing, in its narrow sense, refers to the transfer\n        of funds from industrialized to developing nations in accordance with\n        international agreements such as the Paris Agreement of 2016.\n      </TypographyBody>\n      {demoImage}\n\n      <TypographyTitle>Differential Equations</TypographyTitle>\n      <TypographyBody>\n        As essential and pervasive as they are in science and engineering,\n        partial differential equations are notoriously difficult to solve,\n        assuming they can be solved at all. Even when approximate methods are\n        employed to solve them, it might take millions of CPU hours to solve\n        complex PDEs. As the complexity of the challenges we face increases,\n        from constructing more efficient rocket engines to simulating climate\n        change, we will require more effective and efficient methods for solving\n        these equations. Now, scientists have developed artificial neural\n        networks that can approximate solutions to partial differential\n        equations orders of magnitude faster than conventional PDE solvers. And\n        once trained, the new neural networks can solve an entire family of PDEs\n        without additional training.\n      </TypographyBody>\n      {demoImage}\n\n      <TypographyTitle>Cryptocurrencies</TypographyTitle>\n      <TypographyBody>\n        Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that are supported by\n        cryptographic protocols. They enable safe internet transactions without\n        the use of intermediaries. The term \"Crypto\" refers to the many\n        encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques used to protect these\n        entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs,\n        and hashing. One can mine cryptocurrencies or purchase them on\n        cryptocurrency exchanges. Not all ecommerce websites accept\n        cryptocurrency payments. Even prominent cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin\n        are rarely used for retail purchases. However, cryptocurrencies' rising\n        value has made them attractive as trading instruments. In a limited\n        capacity, they are also used for international transfers.\n      </TypographyBody>\n      {demoImage}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
